AI-ENHANCED-FLIGHT-DECISION-SUPPORT-SEOUL-TOKYO

This project is NOT designed for actual flight execution. A Cessna 172's maximum range is 1,185 km, making a 1,147 km Seoul-to-Tokyo flight highly impractical. However, this code simulates an AI-driven decision support system for pilot assistance, optimizing route planning and emergency response.

AI Decision Support: Seoul to Tokyo Flight Simulator

This AI-powered copilot models real-time flight decision-making for a simulated journey from Seoul to Tokyo in a Cessna 172, integrating:

Neural Networks for risk prediction

Dynamic Flight Data Updates

Tkinter GUI for real-time monitoring

Weight & CG Calculations for stability analysis

Key Features

1. Seoul-Tokyo Route

Simulates a 1,147 km flight, tracking fuel, speed, and altitude.

Constraints include a 1,185 km maximum range limitation.

2. Weight & CG Dynamics

Adjusts aircraft performance based on pilot & cargo weight.

Computes center of gravity (CG) for stability adjustments.

3. Neural Network Inference

A Keras model classifies flight states as "critical" or "non-critical."

AI copilots provide real-time assistance based on environmental changes.

4. Real-Time Data Simulation

ADS-B-like data updates for altitude, wind, and fuel dynamics.

The system processes changes every 0.5 seconds.

5. Pilot GUI

Tkinter interface displays real-time flight status and AI recommendations.

Alerts for stall warnings, low fuel, and adverse weather conditions.

Installation

1. Clone this repository:

 git clone https://github.com/imnotwcked/AI-ENHANCED-FLIGHT-DECISION-SUPPORT-SEOUL-TOKYO-
 cd AI-ENHANCED-FLIGHT-DECISION-SUPPORT-SEOUL-TOKYO-

2. Install dependencies:

 pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Run the simulation:

 python ai_decision_support.py

2. Input flight parameters:

Example:

 Pilot weight (lbs): 145
 Cargo weight (lbs): 50

3. Observe the AI in action:

The GUI updates every 0.5 seconds.

AI recommendations appear for low fuel, turbulence, or high RPMs.

Experimental Results

Flight Duration: ~5 hours at 230 km/h cruise speed.

Simulation Completion:

Successful landing in Tokyo (~5,000 steps), OR

Fuel depletion & forced landing

Real-Time Updates: Altitude, speed, fuel, and weather conditions refresh dynamically.

Code Explanation

flight_decision_support.py is divided into:

1. Global Constants

Placeholder values for physics, distances (e.g., AIR_DENSITY, FUEL_BURN_RATE, etc.)

2. FlightState Dataclass

Stores key flight variables like altitude, airspeed, fuel, weather severity, and distance remaining.

3. AIDecisionSupport Class

Builds/Trains a Neural Network (toy dataset) for ‚Äúcritical vs. non-critical‚Äù flight conditions.

Runs Flight Simulation Logic: Periodically updates altitude, speed, fuel consumption, and weather conditions.

Condition Checks: AI copilots analyze risk factors and suggestive actions.

Tkinter GUI: Displays real-time flight parameters and AI-driven recommendations.

4. main() Function

User Input: Prompts pilot & cargo weight.

AI Execution: Instantiates AIDecisionSupport and starts the simulation loop.
